        No one exercise prescription is right for everyone; we would rather assess you and customise something to meet your requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Train on your own, train in a small group or train one on one with one of our trainers ( the latter definitely helps with motivation and results). 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are smaller more personal and able to give individual time and input to each of our members. We teach you what to do, and why. We joke that we are the gym where ‘everybody knows your name’ and it is true!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want full length mirrors, lines and lines of cardio gear, and body builders strutting about then please go somewhere else. If you want a pleasant environment with friendly helpful staff, and equipment that you actually get taught to use properly then @@Fit is for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you traditionally have been turned off by big gyms then don’t worry – so have we. We have designed the type of place where people feel empowered to exercise, without feeling intimidated. Come in and see why we think we are really on to something.
    </p>
    <p>
        All new members spend a sessions with one of our Health and Fitness Professional to ensure you know exactly what you are doing, and why you are doing it. We spend time with you up front so you get the greatest benefits from exercise.
