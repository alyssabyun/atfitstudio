                        @@FIT was started with only one goal in mind. To get our clients FANTASTIC results in the shortest time frame possible, with out turning their lives upside down to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand that people don’t want to live in the gym or follow ridiculous diet plans. We understand that to some people exercise is a scary word or a swear word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also understand that if you could do it on your own – you would probably be there now and that the best way to achieve any goal is to be coached right to the finish line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have created a home away from home, a small boutique environment where we have friends, not clients (read our success stories page) come to achieve their goals. Here you are not a membership number, instead more of a family member where everyone knows your name and encourages and supports you to your goal.
